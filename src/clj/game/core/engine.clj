;; resolve-ability docs

; Perhaps the most important function in the game logic.

; Resolves an ability defined by the given ability map. Checks :req functions; shows prompts, psi games,
; traces, etc. as needed; charges costs; invokes :effect functions. All card effects and most engine effects
; should run through this method. Unless noted, every key listed is optional.

; How to read this:
; :key -- type
;   Description, reasoning, expected return value, etc.

; Types:
; integer, string, keyword: clojure literals
; boolean: clojure literal, but should generally only be true (as leaving it off counts as false)
; vector: can be a literal [] or '(), can also be the return value of a function, but
;   must not be a function definition that returns a vector or list
; map of X: clojure literal. X is a comma-separated list of allowed keys.
;   The description will be laid out recursively, and keys will be marked as required or optional.
; ability map: an ability map as defined here.
; enum: a comma-separated list of values, one of which can be used.
; 5-fn: typically (req), but any function definition that takes state, side, eid, card, targets.

; Something that accepts different types will have the types separated by "or".
; For example, "string or 5-fn" means it accepts a string or a 5-fn. The description will
; say what the 5-fn should return, if anything.

; COMMON KEYS
; :req -- 5-fn
;   Must return true or false. If false, the ability will not be resolved.
; :cost -- vector
;   A vector of ->c costs to charge, for example [(->c :credit 1) (->c :click 1)].
;   If the costs cannot be paid, the ability will not be resolved.
; :msg -- string or 5-fn.
;   Must return a string. (`msg` is expressly built for this.)
;   Prints to the log when the ability is finished. Will be used as the :label if no :label is provided.
;   The output is written as:
;     (with cost) "{Player} pays {X} to use {card title} to {msg result}."
;     (with no cost) "{Player} uses {card title} to {msg result}."
;   so the returned string should always be written imperatively.
; :label -- string
;   If this ability is in an :abilities map on a card, the label will be prepended with a string
;   of the costs, and both will be displayed in the ability button. If this is not defined
;   and a label is needed, :msg will be used if it is a string.
; :effect -- 5-fn
;   Will be called if the ability will be resolved (if :req is true or not present,
;   costs can be paid, and any prompts are resolved).
; :player -- enum: :corp, :runner
;   Manually specifies which player the ability should affect, rather than leave it implicit.
; :async -- boolean
;   Mark the ability as "async", meaning the :effect function must call effect-completed itself.
;   Without this being set to true, resolve-ability will call effect-completed once it's done.
;   This part of the engine is really dumb and complicated, so ask someone on slack about it.

; PROMPT KEYS
; :prompt -- string or 5-fn
;   Must return a string to display in the prompt menu.
; :choices -- 5-fn or :credit or :counter or map
;   This key signals a prompt of some kind. (It should be split into multiple keys, but that's a lot of work lol)
;   * 5-fn
;       Must return a vector of card objects or strings.
;       User chooses one. This is called a 'choice' prompt.
;   * :credit
;       User chooses an integer up to their current credit amount.
;   * :counter
;       User chooses an integer up to the :counter value of the current card.
;   * map of :number, :default
;       User chooses an integer between 0 and some number
;       :number -- 5-fn
;         Required. Must return a number, which is the maximum allowed.
;       :default -- 5-fn
;         Optional. Must return a number, which is the number the dropdown will display initially.
;   * map of :card or :req, :all, :max, :not-self
;       Triggers a 'select' prompt with targeting cursor for "selecting" one or more cards.
;       :card -- 1-argument function
;         Either this or :req is required, but not both.
;         Accepts a single card object, must return true or false to indicate if selection is successful.
;       :req -- 5-fn
;         Either this or :card is required, but not both.
;         "target" is the clicked card. Must return true or false to indicate if selection is successful.
;       :all -- boolean
;         Optional. Changes the select prompt from optional (can click "Done" to not select anything) to
;         mandatory. When :max is also set to true, enforces selecting the specified number of cards.
;       :min -- integer or 5-fn
;         Optional. Changes the select to only show "Done" button after this number of cards have been
;         selected. Only used if :all is not set.
;       :max -- integer or 5-fn
;         Optional. Changes the select from to resolving after selecting a single card to
;         resolving when either a number of cards (as set by :max) have been selected or a number
;         of cards less than that set by :max are selected and the "Done" button has been clicked.
;         When :all is also set to true, enforces selecting the specified number of cards.
;       :not-self -- boolean
;         Certain abilities can target any card on the table, others can only target other cards.
;         For example, Yusuf vs Aesop's. Setting this is the same as adding
;         `(not (same-card? % card))` to your :card function or `(not (same-card? target card))`
;         to your :req function.
; :not-distinct -- boolean
;   By default, duplicate entries of the same string will be combined into a single button.
;   If set to true, duplicate entries of the same string will be shown as multiple buttons.
; :cancel-effect -- 5-fn
;   If a prompt with the choice "Cancel" is clicked, the prompt exits without doing anything else
;   and this function will be called.

; SIMULTANEOUS EFFECT RESOLUTION KEYS
; :interactive -- 5-fn. when simultaneous effect resolution has been enabled for a specific event, the user receives
;                 a menu of cards that handle the effect and get to choose the order of their resolution. This menu is
;                 only shown if at least one ability handling the event has an :interactive function that returns true.
;                 If none are interactive, then all handlers will be resolved automatically, one at a time in an
;                 arbitrary order. In general, handlers should be marked ':interactive (req true)' if they have
;                 important order-of-effect interactions with other cards. The :interactive function can be coded to
;                 have smarter logic if necessary -- see Replicator, which is only interactive if there is another
;                 copy of the installed card remaining in the Stack.
; :silent -- any handler that does not require user interaction under any circumstances can be marked :silent. If a
;            handler's :silent function returns true, then no menu entry will be shown for the handler. In that case,
;            the ability will only be resolved once all non-silent abilities are resolved. Example: AstroScript has no
;            important interactions with other 'agenda scored' effects, and doesn't care when an agenda token is placed.
;            Example: Hayley Kaplan will not show a prompt if there are no valid targets in the grip.

; OTHER KEYS
; :once -- :per-turn, :per-run, or :per-encounter. signifies an effect that can only be triggered once per turn, per run, or per encounter.
; :once-key -- keyword. by default, each :once is distinct per card. If multiple copies of a card can only resolve
;              some ability once between all of them, then the card should specify a manual :once-key that can
;              be any value, preferrably a unique keyword.
; :install-req -- a function which returns a list of servers a card may be installed into
; :makes-run -- boolean. indicates if the ability makes a run.

; COMPLEX ABILITY WRAPPERS
; These are wrappers around more complex/cumbersome functionality. They all call into a flow that would
; be cumbersome to write out every time in a "normal" ability map.
; :psi -- map of :req, :equal, :not-equal
;   Handles psi games.
;   :req -- 5-fn
;     Optional. Works same as :req in an ability map.
;   :equal -- ability map
;     At least one of :equal and :not-equal are required.
;     Async ability that is executed if the players reveal the same number of credits.
;   :not-equal -- ability map
;     At least one of :equal and :not-equal are required.
;     Async ability that is executed if the players reveal the a differen number of credits.
; :trace -- map of :req, :label, :base, :successful, :unsuccessful, :kicker, :kicker-min
;   Handles traces.
;   :req -- 5-fn
;     Optional. Works same as :req in an ability map.
;   :label -- 5-fn
;     Optional. Works same as :label in an ability map.
;   :base -- integer or 5-fn
;     Required. Must return an integer, which sets the "base" initial value for the trace.
;   :successful -- ability map
;     At least one of :successful and :unsuccessful are required.
;     Async ability that is executed if the trace is successful.
;   :unsuccessful -- ability map
;     At least one of :successful and :unsuccessful are required.
;     Async ability that is executed if the trace is unsuccessful.
;   :kicker -- ability map
;     Optional. Async ability that is executed if the corp's trace strength is equal to or greater
;     than :kicker-min.
;   :kicker-min -- integer
;     Required if :kicker is defined. The number the corp's strength must be equal to or greater
;     to execute the :kicker ability.
; :optional -- map of :req, :prompt, :player, :yes-ability, :no-ability, :end-effect, :autoresolve
;   Shows a "Yes/No" prompt to handle the user deciding whether to resolve the ability.
;   :req -- 5-fn
;     Optional. Works same as :req in an ability map.
;   :prompt -- string or 5-fn
;     Required. Must return a string to display in the prompt menu.
;   :player -- enum: :corp, :runner
;     Optional. Hardcodes which player will resolve this prompt.
;   :yes-ability -- ability-map
;     At least one of :yes-ability and :no-ability are required. (Normally, this should always
;     be defined, but sometimes it's easier to word things in the negative, such that only
;     defining :no-ability is the most natural way to write the ability.)
;     Async ability that is executed if "Yes" is chosen.
;   :no-ability -- ability-map
;     At least one of :yes-ability and :no-ability are required. (See note above.)
;     Async ability that is executed if "No" is chosen, or if "Yes" is chosen but there's
;     no :yes-ability defined, or :yes-ability has a :cost that the player can't afford.
;   :end-effect -- 5-fn
;     Called after :yes- or :no-ability has been resolved.
;     Must not be async as it is not awaited.
;   :autoresolve -- 5-fn
;     Optional. Used to set an optional prompt to either ask, always choose "Yes", or always choose "No".
;     Must use the (get-autoresolve kw) helper function, where kw is an ability-specific
;     keyword that will be stored in the card's [:special] map.
;     Must use the (set-autoresolve kw) helper function in the card's :abilities vector,
;     to allow for changing the autoresolve settings, where kw is the same keyword as used in
;     the (get-autoresolve kw) call.

  "Triggers the given event by showing a prompt of all handlers for the event, allowing manual resolution of

  eid: the eid of the entire triggering sequence, which will be completed when all handlers are completed
  event: the event keyword to trigger handlers for
  first-ability: an ability map (fed to resolve-ability) that should be resolved after the list of handlers is determined
                 but before any of them is actually fired. Typically used for core rules that happen in the same window
                 as triggering handlers, such as trashing a corp Current when an agenda is stolen. Necessary for
                 interaction with New Angeles Sol and Employee Strike
  card-ability:  a card's ability that triggers at the same time as the event trigger, but is coded as a card ability
                 and not an event handler. (For example, :stolen on agendas happens in the same window as :agenda-stolen
  after-active-player: an ability to resolve after the active player's triggers resolve, before the opponent's get to act
  cancel-fn:     a function that takes one argument (the state) and returns true if we should stop the event resolution
                 process, likely because an event handler caused a change to the game state that cancels future handlers.
